# Demographic-Face-Recognition
I have developed a Demographic Face Recognition model using a CNN


# About Dataset
# UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). 
# The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
# The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.
# Kaggle url for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new
# This dataset serves as a baseline for face pictures and includes noise, lighting, posing, and looks, among other real-world imaging scenarios.
# The labels of each face image is embedded in the file name, formated like [age][gender][race]_[date&time].jpg
# For gender, 0 indicate male and 1 indicate female
# For race, 0 indicate White, 1 indicate black, 2 indicate Asian, 3 indicate Indian and 4 indicate Other races
